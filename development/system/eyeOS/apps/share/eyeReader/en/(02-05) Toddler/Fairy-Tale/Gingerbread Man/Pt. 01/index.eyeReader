Once upon a time there was a little old woman and a little old man. The little old woman thought she'd make a gingerbread man. She rolled out the dough, and cut out the shape, and she put raisins for his eyes, and peppermints for his teeth, and put icing on his head for the hair. Then she put him in the oven, and when it smelled good, she opened up the door to take a peek and--- Yooop!---out jumped the gingerbread man."Stop! Stop, little gingerbread man!" said the little old lady. "I want to eat you!""No!" said the little gingerbread man. "I can run away from you!"[i]"Run, run, fast as you can!Can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man!"[/i]

And away he ran!He ran till he got outside, where he saw the little old man. And the little old man said, "Stop! Stop little gingerbread man! I want to eat you!"And the little gingerbread man said: "NO! I ran away from the little old woman, and I can run away from you too![i]Run, run, fast as you can!Can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man!"[/i]and away he ran!He ran till he came to the pigsty. And the pig said"(Oink Oink)-- Stop! Stop little gingerbread man! I want to eat you!"But the gingerbread man said, "NO! I ran away from the little old woman, I ran away from the little old man, and I can run away from you too![i]Run, run, fast as you can!Can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man!"[/i]and away he ran!He ran till he came to a house. And in front of the house was a dog. And the dog said, "STOP! Stop stop stop stop stoooooooooop! Little gingerbread man! I want to eat you!"But the gingerbread man said, "NO! I ran away from the little old woman, and the little old man, and a pig, and I can run away from you too!"[i]Run, run, fast as you can!Can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man!"[/i]and away he ran!He ran till he came to a field full of cows. And the cows said,"Mooooo! Stoooooooop! Stoooooooop little gingerbread man. We want to eat you!" ....
